# Building Applications with React and Redux in ES6

## Get Started
This repository is a practice that I learned course from [coryhouse](https://www.pluralsight.com/authors/cory-house).

1. **Install** [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org).
2. **Install** [npm](https://www.npmjs.com). npm is the package manager for JavaScript.
3. **Clone this repository.** `git clone https://github.com/vuhoanglinh/redux-react-learn.git`
 or [download the zip](https://github.com/vuhoanglinh/redux-react-learn/archive/master.zip).
4. **Make sure you're in the directory you just cloned.** `cd redux-react-learn`.
5. **Install Node packages**. `npm install`
6. **Run the app.** `npm start -s`.
7. **Install** [React developer tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en) and [Redux Dev Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en) in Chrome.
